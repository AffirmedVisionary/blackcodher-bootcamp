          <p>During my time on the Black Codher Bootcamp, we were assigned a number of projects along the way and my interpretation of them can be found here.</p>
            <p>To Navigate through them you can use the contents table below and the links in the footer of each page.</p>

I really enjoyed the progression of this project</td>
